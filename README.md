# eMerchant

I developed this application as the final project of Turkcell GeleceÄŸi Yazanlar Android Bootcamp. The application is an e-commerce application that uses data provided by dummyjson.com service. 
It lists the products on the Home page, and you can go to the details of the listed products. On the detail page, products can be added to favorites and to the cart. 
It lists category titles on the Categories page, each category title lists the products in the relevant category. The Search header provides the product search feature. 
On the Likes page, user-specific liked products are listed. On the Cart page, the products added to the user-specific cart are listed. User-specific orders are listed on the Orders page. User information is listed on the Profile page and can be updated.
